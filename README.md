# Digikala-Checkout-Discovery

Digikala Checkout & Discovery:
We want to implement a small flow of digikala:

1- load a list of products (PLP or product list page)

2- user can add to cart in details page.

3- user also can add to cart from products in list (home) that we name it quick add to
cart.

4- The user can go to the cart page and see the cart.

5- The user can see the cart on the home page with a modal.

Project aspects:

1- API doc: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10022171/TzXzEHFr

2- This app should have three pages: list page(home), details page and cart page.

3- list page renders the list of the products. Every product should have a detail page link
on their item.

4- list page should have pagination or infinite scroll.

5- Shopping cart have to persist. Means that if the user closes the application then
reopen it, can see previous shopping cart data.

6- if the user clicks on product items in PLP, show the details page (PDP or product
details page)

P.S: for using api you should set a static token in the header that is provided in the
document.

P.S: PLP (product list page) endpoint used for search, so you should use it for list page
and PDP (product details page) is used for details page.

Additional parts:

1- sorting or filters. Use the filters data that sends in PLP request.

2- set search params in page address is appreciated.

3- search with api calls.

4- better UI, means better project.5- add to cart process that handles with state management (redux or vuex) is additional
score.

6- show the cart in the home ( in a good way such as modal ).

Project rules:

1- it is forbidden to use UI libraries like material design or css libraries like bootstrap.

2- if you use state management, you should use redux.

3- if you want to use a front-end framework, you can use ReactJs.

4- Clean the errors and warnings from the project.

Valuable parts:

1- follow best practices.

2- directories and project structure is important.

3- clean code.

4- please implement the best project that you can, if you donâ€™t have enough time, please
implement as much as you can in the best way. Good project is more valuable than a
complete project.

Hint:

If you have a problem with CORS you can use this extension or any other solution that
you decide.

If you have any question or any problem please contact us at frontend @ digikala.com
email.

**NOTE** add / to the end of the API endpoints, otherwise you will face a CORS error.
